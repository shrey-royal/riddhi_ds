Arrays:

1. Check if pair with given Sum exists in Array:

> Given an array A[] of n numbers and another number x, the task is to check whether or not there exist two elements in A[] whose sum is exactly x. 

Input: arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}, x= -2
Output: Yes
Explanation:  If we calculate the sum of the output,1 + (-3) = -2

Input: arr[] = {1, -2, 1, 0, 5}, x = 0
Output: No

2. Find common elements in three sorted arrays

Input: 
ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80} 
ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100} 
ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120} 
Output: 20, 80

Input: 
ar1[] = {1, 5, 5} 
ar2[] = {3, 4, 5, 5, 10} 
ar3[] = {5, 5, 10, 20} 
Output: 5, 5

3. Find the element that appears once in an array where every other element appears twice

> Given an array of integers. All numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once. Find the number in O(n) time & constant extra space.

Input:  arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4}
Output: 2 

4. Find the only repetitive element between 1 to N-1

> Given an array of size N filled with numbers from 1 to N-1 in random order. The array has only one repetitive element. The task is to find the repetitive element.

Input: a[] = {1, 3, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 3
Explanation: The number 3 is the only repeating element.

Input: a[] = {1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1

5. Majority Element

> Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).

Input : A[]={3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4}
Output : 4
Explanation: The frequency of 4 is 5 which is greater than the half of the size of the array size. 

Input : A[] = {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4}
Output : No Majority Element
Explanation: There is no element whose frequency is greater than the half of the size of the array size.

6. Find all triplets with zero sum

> Given an array of distinct elements. The task is to find triplets in the array whose sum is zero.

Input: arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
Output: (0 -1 1), (2 -3 1)
Explanation: The triplets with zero sum are 0 + -1 + 1 = 0 and 2 + -3 + 1 = 0  

Input: arr[] = {1, -2, 1, 0, 5}
Output: 1 -2  1
Explanation: The triplets with zero sum is 1 + -2 + 1 = 0   

7. Find a pair with the given difference

> Given an unsorted array and a number n, find if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose difference is n. 

Input: arr[] = {5, 20, 3, 2, 50, 80}, n = 78
Output: Pair Found: (2, 80)

Input: arr[] = {90, 70, 20, 80, 50}, n = 45
Output: No Such Pair

8. Find closest number in Sorted array

> Given an array of sorted integers. We need to find the closest value to the given number. Array may contain duplicate values and negative numbers. 

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9}
             Target number = 11
Output : 9
9 is closest to 11 in given array

Input :arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9}; 
       Target number = 4
Output : 5
5 is closest to 4 in given array

Input :arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 15, 19, 22, 32}; 
       Target number = 34
Output : 32
32 is closest to 34 in given array
